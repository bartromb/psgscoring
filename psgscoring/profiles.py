psgscoring.profiles
====================

Scoring profile definitions for psgscoring v0.4.0.

This module provides a unified framework for running PSG respiratory
event scoring under multiple historical and dataset-specific rule sets.

Profile families:
    - clinical : AASM-compliant profiles (v1/v2/v3 + CMS + exploratory)
    - dataset  : Faithful reproduction of NSRR scoring conventions
    - legacy   : Pre-AASM Chicago criteria

Usage:
    >>> from psgscoring.profiles import get_profile, list_profiles
    >>> profile = get_profile("aasm_v3_rec")
    >>> profile.hypopnea.flow_reduction_threshold
    0.30

    >>> list_profiles()
    ['aasm_v3_rec', 'aasm_v3_strict', 'aasm_v3_sensitive',
     'aasm_v2_rec', 'aasm_v1_rec', 'cms_medicare',
     'mesa_shhs', 'chicago_1999']
